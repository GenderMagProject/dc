== GenderMag Design Catalog ==

The purpose of the design catalog is to provide ideas for making software user interfaces inclusive to more cognitive styles.

-- How to Add to the Catalog --
1. Create a new folder. The name of the folder is the name that will appear on the website.
2. Add these files to the folder:
	- cats.txt (the non-facet categories the design goes in, one per line. options: survey, opensource, website)
	- problem.txt (why the design isn't inclusive to some cognitive styles)
	- solution.txt (how the design tries to solve the problem)
	- facets.txt (one facet per line, use these abbreviations: m, cse, atr, ips, ls)
	- zoom_before.png (what the design looked like before it was changed; png or jpg; other image formats might also work)
	- zoom_after.png (what the design looked like after it was changed; png or jpg; other image formats might also work)
