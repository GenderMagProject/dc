	- problem.txt (why the design isn't inclusive to some cognitive styles)
	- solution.txt (how the design tries to solve the problem)
	- facets.txt (one facet per line, use these abbreviations: m, cse, atr, ips, ls)
	- zoom_before.png (what the design looked like before it was changed; png or jpg; other image formats might also work)
	- zoom_after.png (what the design looked like after it was changed; png or jpg; other image formats might also work)
