				<span>About the 5 GenderMag Facets</span>
			</div>
			<div id="explanation">
				GenderMag uses 5 facets to characterize the different personas: information processing style, learning style, computer self-efficacy, attitude toward risk, and motivations. 
				Each persona represents a set of cognitive styles for using technology that statistically clusters by gender. Personas, a set of fictional people who have a particular value for each of the 5 facets, plus some background and other characteristics to bring the facets to life. Though the persona is fictitious, they are a research-grounded user of a technology product or service. Gender Mag uses 3 personas Abi, Pat, and Tim.  It’s worth noting that each facet is a spectrum and that people’s tendencies can vary along with those spectra. Even an individual can have different facet values at different times or depend on the context. However, research shows that facet values do tend to cluster by gender.

			<h2>Information processing style</h2>

			</figure>
			<ul>
			<li>To solve problems with technology, people need to look at and understand, new information.</li>
			<li>Research shows that men tend to select promising leads, then backtrack if needed when using technology.</li>
			<li> Women tend to gather information more comprehensively, collecting a fairly complete set of necessary information before proceeding.</li>
			</ul>

			
			<h2>Learning style for new technology</h2>
			<figure>
			<img src="ls-black.png" alt="Learning style" />
			</figure>
			<ul>
			<li>In our research, men were much more likely than women to “tinker”. That is, playfully engage with a piece of technology on the way to learning it.</li> 
			<li>Women tended to follow a process when it came to learning.</li>
			<li> Note though that when women did tinker, they tended to do so more mindfully than men, and learned more thoroughly.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Computer self-efficacy</h2>
			<figure>
			<img src="cse-black.png" alt="Computer self-efficacy"/>
			</figure>
			<ul>
			<li>This concerns a person’s confidence that they’ll succeed at a specific task using technology.</li>
			<li>It’s important because it concerns how likely a person is to give up on a task, cognitive strategies, and how they cope when presented with obstacles.</li>
			<li> Research showed that men tended to have higher computer self-efficacy than women.</li>
			</ul>


			<h2>Attitude toward risk</h2>
			<figure>
			<img src="atr-black.png" alt="Attitude toward risk" />
			</figure>
			<ul>
			<li>Research has indicated that women tend to be more risk-averse than men.</li>
			<li>This means that women may not engage with certain feature sets and waste their valuable time as they may consider the risk of using them to be too high.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Motivations</h2>
			<figure>
			<img src="m-black.png" alt="Motivations"/>
			</figure>
			<ul>
			<li>Why is the person using this technology?</li>
			<li>Research showed that the tendency to use technology for the love of technology is more prevalent among men.</li>
			<li>Women tended to use technology because they had a particular task to carry out.</li>    
			</ul>
