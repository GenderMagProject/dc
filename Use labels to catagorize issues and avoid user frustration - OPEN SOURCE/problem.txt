The issue list for this open source project doesn't allow users easily parse through the issues to confidently choose one that fits their skill level.
<br></br>Selective readers (<b><i>Information Processing Style</b></i>) would want an easier way to identify issues to work on without having to read the titles and descriptions for each issue. Additionally, user's who are risk averse (<b><i>Attitude Toward Risk</b></i>) and/or have low computer self efficacy (<b><i>Computer Self-Efficacy</b></i>) would not feel confident choosing an issue based on what they see in the current issue list.
