				<span>About the 5 GenderMag Facets</span>
			</div>
			<div id="explanation">
				GenderMag uses 5 facets to characterize the different personas: information processing style, learning style, computer self-efficacy, attitude toward risk, and motivations. 
				Each persona represents a set of cognitive styles for using technology, which are statistically clustered by gender. Personas, a set of fictional people who have a particular value for each of the 5 facets, plus some background and other characteristics to bring the facets to life. Though the persona is fictitious, they are a research-grounded user of a technology product or service. Gender Mag uses 3 personas <a href="AbiPersona.pdf">Abi</a>, <a href="PatriciaPersona.pdf">Pat</a> and <a href="TimPersona.pdf">Tim</a>.  It’s worth noting that each facet is a spectrum and that people’s tendencies can vary along with those spectrum. An individual can have different facet values at different times depending on the context. However, research shows that facet values do tend to cluster by gender.

			<span>Motivations</span>
		</div>
	
		<div class="panel">
		<div class="panel_headings">
			What is it?
			</div>
			<br>
		Motivation refers to why the person is using this technology? What do they hope to achieve? <br>
		<br>
		<div class="panel_headings">
			Why is it relevant?
			</div>
			<br>
		Research showed that the tendency to use technology for the love of technology is more prevalent among men. Women tended to use technology because they had a particular task to carry out.<br>
		<br>
		<div class="panel_headings">
			Evidence in the Personas
			</div>
			<br>
		In the Abi persona, Abi's motivation to use technology is to accomplish tasks. She prefers to use methods/features she already knows when she can.<br>
		<br>
		In contrast the Tim perosna, uses technology in a broader scope. He likes to explore features regardless of whether they will be helpful in acomplishing his tasks.<br>

			<span>Computer Self-Efficacy</span>
		</div>

		<div class="panel">
		<div class="panel_headings">
			What is it?
			</div>
			<br>
			Computer Self-Efficacy takes into account a person’s confidence level on  whether they’ll succeed at a specific task using technology. In gives insignt on how likely a person is to give up on a task, cognitive strategies, and how they cope when presented with obstacles. <br>
			<br>
			<div class="panel_headings">
			Why is it relevant?
			</div>
			<br>
			 Research showed that men tended to have higher computer self-efficacy than women.<br>
			<br>
			<div class="panel_headings">
			Evidence in the Personas
			</div>
			<br>
			The two extremes of Computer Self-Efficay are shown in the Abi and Tim personas.<br>
			<br>
			Abi has lower self confidence than her peers about doing unfamiliar computing tasks. If problems arise, she is more likely to blame herself.<br>
			<br>
			In contrast, Tim has high confidence in his abilities with technology, and thinks he’s better than the average person at learning about new features. If he can’t fix the problem, he blames it on the software vendor.<br>

			<span>Attitude towards Risk</span>
		</div>

		<div class="panel">
		<div class="panel_headings">
			What is it?
			</div>
			<br>
			Attitute towards risk refers to whether people will venture and engage with certian feautres that might not be helpful or waste time.<br>
			<br>
			<div class="panel_headings">
			Why is it relevant?
			</div>
			<br>
			Research has indicated that women tend to be more risk-averse than men.<br>
			This means that there is a group of user who may not engage with certain features, as they may consider the risk of using them to be too high and potentially waste time.<br>
			<br>
			<div class="panel_headings">
			Evidence in the Personas
			</div>
			<br>
			The Abi persona represnts those who risk averse about using unfamiliar technologies that may require more time to learn and use them, even if the new features might be relevant; whether that may be due to have little spare time or other factors. Instead she works with features she is already familiar with.
			<br>
			<br>
			The Tim persona represents those who doesn’t mind taking risks when using features of technology that haven’t been proven to work. Regardless of whether certain features work or not his attitude towards technology remains the same.<br>

			<span>Information Processing Style</span>
		</div>
    
		<div class="panel">
			<div class="panel_headings">
			What is it?
			</div>
			<br>
			Information processing style refers to how people look at and understand, new information in order to solve problems with technology.<br>
			<br>
			<div class="panel_headings">
			Why is it relevant?
			</div>
			<br>
			Research shows that men tend to select promising leads, then backtrack if needed when using technology.<br>
			Women tend to gather information more comprehensively, collecting a fairly complete set of necessary information before proceeding.<br>
			<br>
			<div class="panel_headings">
			Evidence in the Personas
			</div>
			<br>
			A diffrence in information processing styles is seen in the contrast of the Abi and Tim persona. <br>
			<br>
			Abi tends towards a comprehensive information processing style when she needs more information. So she gathers as much information possible about the problem before attempting to solve it.<br>
			<br>
			Tim in contrast, leans towards a selective information processing style or “depth first” approach. He pursues the first promising option to solve the problem, and works backwards if it doesn't work.

			<span>Learning Style</span>
		</div>

		<div class="panel">
		<div class="panel_headings">
			What is it?
			</div>
			<br>
			Learning style refers to how people interact and go about technologies that are new or unknown to them.<br>
			<br>
			<div class="panel_headings">
			Why is it relevant?
			</div>
			<br>
			In our research, men were much more likely than women to “tinker”. That is, playfully engage with a piece of technology while learning it<br>
			Women tended to follow a process when it came to learning.<br>
			Note when women did tinker, they tended to do so more mindfully than men, and learned more thoroughly.<br>
			<br>
			<div class="panel_headings">
			Evidence in the Personas
			</div>
			<br>
			In our Personas, Abi represents the group of users who are more process oriented. Those who refer to tutorials, step-by-step
			processes, wizards, online how-to videos, etc.<br>
			<br>
			The Tim persona, contrasts this by representing users who try to construct their own understanding of how the software/technology works internally, through tinkering;exploring the menu items and functions of the software in order to build that understanding.<br>
			<br>
			The Pat persona represents the middle ground; those who explore features more purposefully. That is reflecting on each bit of
			feedback they get along the way to understand how the features might be beneficial.

			<p>The design catalog shows evidence-based examples of design changes that help improve problems that occur when not all the possible facet values are incropareted. Examples of diffrent facet values are shown in the persona documents.</p>
