This benefits Tim because it gives the user a small selection of important information about each persona, making it possible for them to select a persona without needing to see their full biographies. For a user like Abi whose motivation is to choose the persona they need without wasting time on other pursuits, this modification allows the user to read a quick blurb about each persona and to select their ideal persona right away, without losing focus on their task at hand.
